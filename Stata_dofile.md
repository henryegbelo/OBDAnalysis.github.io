Household Survey Summary and Analysis

The purpose of the above Stata do file is to perform data analysis and generate summary statistics for a dataset related to household surveys. The file carries out several data manipulations and calculations to derive useful information from the dataset. 

The main objective of the do file is to extract relevant information from the dataset and present it in a structured format for further analysis and reporting. It aims to identify household heads, calculate the number of households uploaded per community, determine the start and end dates of data collection, and generate summary statistics at the state, LGA (Local Government Area), ward, and community levels. The file also generates three output tables, labeled as Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3, which provide insights into the data.

The expected result of running the do file is the creation of output files in Excel format (.xls). These output files contain the summarized data and statistics, such as the identified household heads, the number of households enumerated, and the total number of households, communities, LGAs, and wards. The output tables provide a clear overview of the data and facilitate further analysis or reporting on the household survey.
